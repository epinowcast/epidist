First, use Gillepsie algorithm generate infectious disease outbreak data (Figure 3.1) stochastic compartmental model. Figure 3.1: Early epidemic, high rate growth new cases. people infected, rate growth slows. (every 50th case shown avoid -plotting.) outbreak data.frame two columns: case ptime. ptime numeric column giving time infection. reality, common receive primary event times date rather numeric. generate secondary events, use lognormal distribution (Figure 3.2) delay primary secondary events: Figure 3.2: lognormal distribution skewed right. Long delay times still probability. Figure 3.3: Secondary events (green) occur delay drawn lognormal distribution (Figure 3.2).Figure 3.1, make figure easier read, every 50th case shown. obs now data.frame columns delay stime. secondary event time simply primary event time plus delay: receive complete data obs simple accurately estimate delay distribution. However, reality, outbreak almost never receive data . First, times primary secondary events usually censored. means rather exact event times, observe event times within interval. suppose interval daily, meaning date primary secondary event, exact event time, reported (Figure 3.4): Figure 3.4: Interval censoring primary secondary event times obscures delay times. common example events reported daily aggregates. daily censoring common, epidist supports primary secondary events delay intervals. outbreak usually estimating delays real time. result cases secondary event occurring time observed. called (right) truncation, biases observation process towards shorter delays. Figure 3.5 see simulation process restricted data include cases secondary event occurred day 10. Figure 3.5: figure duplicates Figure 3.4 adds truncation 10 days due stopping observation period point. Event pairs using dashed lines now observed. can simulate effect right truncation restricting data include cases secondary event occurred observation time. Finally, reality, ’s possible observe every case. suppose sample individuals size sample_size observed: sample size corresponds 7.7% data. Figure 3.6: histogram delays fully observed double interval censored data obs_cens slightly biased relative true distribution (black line). bias absolute (Park et al. 2024) problematic shorter delays. data observed real-time, obs_cens_trunc_samp, biased still due right truncation. bias relative problematic longer delays data truncated. always recommend [Charniga et al. (2024); Table 2] adjusting censoring present considering data also meaningfully right truncated. Another issue, epidist currently account , sometimes secondary event might observed, primary event. example, symptom onset may reported, start infection unknown. Discarding events type leads called ascertainment biases. Whereas case equally likely appear sample , ascertainment bias cases likely appear data others. data now nearly observe practice final step transform use meaningful dates. introduce outbreak_start_date date first infection. resulting simulated data obs_data 4 columns: id, symptom_onset, case_notification, obs_time. symptom_onset case_notification dates obs_date date last observation based case notification.","code":"secondary_dist <- data.frame(mu = 1.6, sigma = 0.5) class(secondary_dist) <- c(\"lognormal_samples\", class(secondary_dist)) secondary_dist <- add_mean_sd(secondary_dist)  secondary_dist #>    mu sigma     mean       sd #> 1 1.6   0.5 5.612521 2.991139 growth_rate <- 0.2 obs_time <- 25 outbreak <- simulate_gillespie(r = growth_rate, seed = 101) outbreak |>   filter(case %% 50 == 0) |>   ggplot(aes(x = ptime, y = case)) +   geom_point(col = \"#56B4E9\") +   labs(x = \"Primary event time (day)\", y = \"Case number\") +   theme_minimal() head(outbreak) #>   case      ptime #> 1    1 0.04884052 #> 2    2 0.06583120 #> 3    3 0.21857827 #> 4    4 0.24963421 #> 5    5 0.30133392 #> 6    6 0.31425010 obs <- simulate_secondary(   outbreak,   dist = rlnorm,   meanlog = secondary_dist[[\"mu\"]],   sdlog = secondary_dist[[\"sigma\"]] ) ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 30)), aes(x = x)) +   geom_function(     fun = dlnorm,     args = list(       meanlog = secondary_dist[[\"mu\"]],       sdlog = secondary_dist[[\"sigma\"]]     )   ) +   theme_minimal() +   labs(     x = \"Delay between primary and secondary event (days)\",     y = \"Probability density\"   ) obs |>   filter(case %% 50 == 0) |>   ggplot(aes(y = case)) +   geom_segment(     aes(x = ptime, xend = stime, y = case, yend = case),     col = \"grey\"   ) +   geom_point(aes(x = ptime), col = \"#56B4E9\") +   geom_point(aes(x = stime), col = \"#009E73\") +   labs(x = \"Event time (day)\", y = \"Case number\") +   theme_minimal() all(obs$ptime + obs$delay == obs$stime) #> [1] TRUE obs_cens <- mutate(   obs,   ptime_lwr = floor(.data$ptime),   ptime_upr = .data$ptime_lwr + 1,   stime_lwr = floor(.data$stime),   stime_upr = .data$stime_lwr + 1,   delay_daily = stime_lwr - ptime_lwr ) p_cens <- obs_cens |>   filter(case %% 50 == 0, case <= 500) |>   ggplot(aes(y = case)) +   geom_segment(     aes(x = ptime, xend = stime, y = case, yend = case),     col = \"grey\"   ) +   # The primary event censoring intervals   geom_errorbarh(     aes(xmin = ptime_lwr, xmax = ptime_upr, y = case),     col = \"#56B4E9\", height = 5   ) +   # The secondary event censoring intervals   geom_errorbarh(     aes(xmin = stime_lwr, xmax = stime_upr, y = case),     col = \"#009E73\", height = 5   ) +   geom_point(aes(x = ptime), fill = \"white\", col = \"#56B4E9\", shape = 21) +   geom_point(aes(x = stime), fill = \"white\", col = \"#009E73\", shape = 21) +   labs(x = \"Event time (day)\", y = \"Case number\") +   theme_minimal() p_cens #> `height` was translated to `width`. #> `height` was translated to `width`. p_trunc <- obs_cens |>   filter(case %% 50 == 0, case <= 500) |>   mutate(     observed = ifelse(stime_upr <= 10, \"observed\", \"not observed\"),     observed = factor(observed, levels = c(\"observed\", \"not observed\"))   ) |>   ggplot(aes(y = case)) +   geom_segment(     aes(x = ptime, xend = stime, y = case, yend = case, linetype = observed),     col = \"grey\"   ) +   # The primary event censoring intervals   geom_errorbarh(     aes(xmin = ptime_lwr, xmax = ptime_upr, y = case),     col = \"#56B4E9\", height = 5   ) +   # The secondary event censoring intervals   geom_errorbarh(     aes(xmin = stime_lwr, xmax = stime_upr, y = case),     col = \"#009E73\", height = 5   ) +   geom_point(aes(x = ptime), fill = \"white\", col = \"#56B4E9\", shape = 21) +   geom_point(aes(x = stime), fill = \"white\", col = \"#009E73\", shape = 21) +   geom_vline(xintercept = 10, col = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +   labs(x = \"Event time (day)\", y = \"Case number\") +   theme_minimal() +   theme(legend.position = \"none\") p_trunc #> `height` was translated to `width`. #> `height` was translated to `width`. obs_cens_trunc <- obs_cens |>   mutate(obs_time = obs_time) |>   filter(.data$stime_upr <= .data$obs_time) sample_size <- 200 obs_cens_trunc_samp <- slice_sample(   obs_cens_trunc,   n = sample_size, replace = FALSE ) #Prepare the complete, retrospective data complete_data <- obs_cens |>   mutate(type = \"Censored retrospective data\") |>   select(delay = delay_daily, type)  # Prepare the censored, truncated, sampled data censored_data <- obs_cens_trunc_samp |>   mutate(type = \"Censored, truncated,\\nsampled data\") |>   select(delay = delay_daily, type)  # Combine the datasets combined_data <- bind_rows(complete_data, censored_data)  # Calculate proportions plot_data <- combined_data |>   group_by(type, delay, .drop = FALSE) |>   summarise(n = n()) |>   mutate(p = n / sum(n)) #> `summarise()` has grouped output by 'type'.
