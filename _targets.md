Analysis Pipeline: Dynamic Truncation
================

# Introduction

-   Reliable estimates of epidemiological distributions are required for
    many applications in real-time. Examples include estimates of the
    incubation period, the time from onset to report, and the time from
    onset to death. These quantities are typically assumed to follow
    parametric distributions but may vary over time and due to the
    characteristics of cases

-   The data used to estimate these distributions can suffer from a
    range of common biases due to censoring and truncation.

-   These are…

-   These are a particular issues for infectious diseases due to the
    exponential nature of transmission…

-   What have other people done?

    -   Examples of good practice
    -   Examples of bad practice (maybe?)
    -   Options for tools to address this issue

-   In this study we explore the impact of these biases on naive
    estimates of a distribution during a simulated outbreak. We then
    evaluate a range of approaches to mitigate these biases and compare
    and contrast there performance. In particular, we focus on the role
    of right-truncation and dynamic adjustments to explore the relative
    advantages as well as if they should be used together. We then apply
    these approaches to a case study…. and discuss the difference in
    estimates. We aim to highlight the implications of common biases
    found when estimating epidemiological distributions and suggest
    approaches to mitigate them.

# Pipeline

The analysis pipeline for this work can be regenerated by rendering this
file,

``` r
rmarkdown::render("_targets.Rmd")
```

The pipeline can then be run using,

``` r
tar_make()
```

The complete pipeline can be visualised using,

``` r
tar_visnetwork()
```

Alternatively the pipeline can be explored interactively using this
notebook or updated programmatically using the scripts in `bin`. We also
provide an archived version of our `targets` workflow if only wanting to
reproduce sections of our analysis. This can be downloaded using the
following,

``` r
source(here::here("R", "targets-archive.R"))
get_targets_archive()
```

# Setup

Set up the workflow pipeline and options. We first load the `targets`
package and remove the potentially outdated workflow.

``` r
library(targets)
library(stantargets)
#> Warning in as.POSIXlt.POSIXct(Sys.time()): unable to identify current timezone 'H':
#> please set environment variable 'TZ'
library(tarchetypes)
library(data.table)
#> Warning: package 'data.table' was built under R version 4.1.3
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr, quietly = TRUE)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'purrr'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:data.table':
#> 
#>     transpose
library(here)
#> here() starts at C:/Users/sangw/Documents/Math/Research/dynamicaltruncation
library(future)
library(future.callr)
tar_unscript()
```

We now define shared global options across our workflow and load R
functions from the `R` folder.

``` r
library(targets)
library(tarchetypes)
library(cmdstanr)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr, quietly = TRUE)
library(here)
library(future)
library(future.callr)
plan(callr)
functions <- list.files(here("R"), full.names = TRUE)
walk(functions, source)
rm("functions")
set_cmdstan_path()  

tar_option_set(
  packages = c("data.table", "ggplot2", "purrr", "cmdstanr", "brms", "here"),
  deployment = "worker",
  memory = "transient",
  workspace_on_error = TRUE,
  error = "continue",
  garbage_collection = TRUE
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/globals/globals.R.
```

# Methods

## Models

We explore a range of models for estimating the log normal distribution.
Starting with the naive continuous model and then gradually adding
complexity to adjust for censoring to dates and right truncation.

``` r
tar_target(models, {
  list(
    "Naive" = naive_delay,
    "Censoring adjusted" = censoring_adjusted_delay,
    "Filtered" = function(data, ...) {
      data <- data |>
        data.table::copy() |>
        DT(stime_daily <= (obs_at - 15))
      naive_delay(data = data, ...)
    },
    "Filtered and censoring adjusted" = function(data, ...) {
      data <- data |>
        data.table::copy() |>
        DT(stime_daily <= (obs_at - 15))
      censoring_adjusted_delay(data = data, ...)
    },
    "Truncation adjusted" = truncation_adjusted_delay,
    "Truncation and censoring adjusted" = truncation_censoring_adjusted_delay,
    "Latent variable truncation and censoring adjusted" =
      latent_truncation_censoring_adjusted_delay
  )
})
#> Define target models from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/models.R.
```

-   File path for each saved model.

``` r
tar_target(
  model_paths,
  paste0(
    "data/models/", gsub(" ", "_", tolower(names(models))), ".stan"
  ) |>
    fs::file_create(),
  format = "file",
  pattern = map(models)
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/model_paths.R.
```

-   Dummy data required for model creation.

``` r
tar_target(dummy_obs, {
  data.table(
    ptime = 1, stime = 2, delay_daily = 1, delay_lwr = 1, delay_upr = 2, 
    ptime_lwr = 1, ptime_upr = 2, stime_lwr = 1, stime_upr = 2, obs_at = 100,
    censored = "interval", censored_obs_time = 10, ptime_daily = 1,
    stime_daily = 1
  )
})
#> Define target dummy_obs from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/dummy_obs.R.
```

-   Generate stan code for each model and compile.

``` r
tar_target(
  model_stan_code, 
  do.call(
    models[[1]],
    list(data = dummy_obs, fn = brms::make_stancode, save_model = model_paths)
  ),
  pattern = map(models, model_paths)
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/model_stan_code.R.
```

### Simulation

### Setup

-   We assume 3 distribution scenarios: short, medium, and long.

``` r
tar_group_by(
  distributions,
    data.table(
    scenario = c("short", "medium", "long"),
    meanlog = c(1.2, 1.6, 2),
    sdlog = c(0.4, 0.6, 0.8)
  ) |>
    DT(, mean := exp(meanlog + sdlog^2/2)) |>
    DT(, sd := exp(meanlog + (1/2)*sdlog^2)*sqrt(exp(sdlog^2) - 1)),
  scenario
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/distributions.R.
```

-   We simulate an outbreak that starts with an initially high and
    stable growth rate that then declines linearly until reaching a
    stable decay rate. **I am now wondering if we want to investigate
    more than one scenario.**

``` r
tar_target(growth_rate, {
  data.table(
    time = 0:59,
    r = c(rep(0.2, 20), 0.2 - 0.02 * 1:20, rep(-0.2, 20))
  )
})
#> Define target growth_rate from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/growth_rate.R.
```

-   We initialise the outbreak to have 20 cases.

``` r
tar_target(init_cases, {
  20
})
#> Define target init_cases from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/init_cases.R.
```

-   Simulate the outbreak. This is temporary and we should fill with a
    stochastic SIR (? or other).

``` r
tar_target(simulated_cases, {
  simulate_uniform_cases(sample_size = 1000, t = 60)
})
#> Define target simulated_cases from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/simulated_cases.R.
```

-   Simulate observations of primary and secondary events as linelist
    for each distribution scenario.

``` r
tar_target(
  simulated_secondary, 
  simulated_cases |>
    simulate_secondary(
      meanlog = distributions[, "meanlog"][[1]],
      sdlog = distributions[, "sdlog"][[1]]
    ),
  pattern = map(distributions)
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/simulated_secondary.R.
```

-   Simulate the observation process

``` r
tar_target(simulated_observations, {
  simulated_secondary |>
    observe_process()
})
#> Define target simulated_observations from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/simulated_observations.R.
```

### Estimate distributions

-   Estimate all models at chosen points across the outbreak
    (suggestion: “early outbreak” (15 days), “near peak” (30 days),
    “past peak” (45 days), “late outbreak” (60 days))

``` r
tar_group_by(
  estimation_times,
  data.table(
    scenario = c("early outbreak", "near peak", "past peak", "late outbreak"),
    time = c(15, 30, 45, 60)
  ),
  scenario
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/estimation_times.R.
```

-   Truncate the available simulate observations based on the estimation
    time for each scenario.

``` r
tar_target(
  truncated_obs,
  simulated_observations |>
    filter_obs_by_obs_time(obs_time = estimation_times[, "time"][[1]]) |>
    DT(, scenario := estimation_times[, "scenario"][[1]]),
  pattern = map(estimation_times)
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/truncated_obs.R.
```

-   Estimate across sample size ranges (N = 10, 100, 1000). `N = 1000`
    is the main case.

``` r
tar_target(sample_sizes, {
  c(10, 100, 1000)
})
#> Define target sample_sizes from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/sample_sizes.R.
```

-   Sample observations

``` r
tar_target(
  sampled_observations,
  truncated_obs[sample(1:.N, sample_sizes, replace = FALSE),] |>
    DT(, sample_size := as.factor(sample_sizes)),
  pattern = sample_sizes
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/sampled_observations.R.
```

-   Create data in the format used by stan for each model

-   Estimate distribution using each model for each sample size and
    time. This is slightly complicated by needing to avoid compilation
    across multiple model fits. See \*\*\*\*.R for a more standard
    implementation of fitting these models.

-   Summarise posteriors for each model and sampled data.

-   Sample model runtimes for each sampled data.

-   Plot distribution summary parameters (log mean and sd) vs true
    values (y facet) by outbreak point (x facet).

### Post-process for dynamic bias

-   Post process all models using dynamic correction and known growth
    rate
-   Same structure as simple distribution estimates

### Summarise runtimes

-   In addition to estimate quality we care about tractibility for the
    SI plot the runtimes of various methods.

## Case study

### Data

-   Need some outbreak linelist data. The UKHSA paper may contain this.
    -   Seb suggest some Ebola linelist data that may be public domain.

### Estimate distributions

-   Estimate distributions for similar points as in the simulation
    setting.

### Estimate growth rate

-   Estimate the growth rate retrospectively and comment on this.

### Post-process for dynamic bias

-   Apply growth rate correction to all estimates

### Summarise runtimes

-   Summarise
