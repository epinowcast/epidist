First, use Gillepsie algorithm generate infectious disease outbreak data (Figure 1.1) stochastic compartmental model: Figure 1.1: Early epidemic, high rate growth new cases. people infected, rate growth slows. (every 50th case shown avoid -plotting.) outbreak data.table columns case ptime. Now, generate secondary events, use lognormal distribution (Figure 1.2) delay primary secondary events: Figure 1.2: lognormal distribution skewed right. Long delay times still probability. Figure 1.3: Secondary events (green) occur delay drawn lognormal distribution (Figure 1.2). Figure 1.1, make figure easier read, every 50th case shown. obs now data.table object columns delay stime. secondary event time simply primary event time plus delay: receive data obs estimating delay distribution easy, epidist package wouldn’t need exist. However, reality, outbreak almost never receive data . First, times primary secondary events usually censored. means rather exact event times, observe event times within interval. suppose interval daily, meaning date primary secondary event, exact event time, reported (Figure 1.4): Figure 1.4: Interval censoring primary secondary event times obscures delay times. daily censoring common, epidist supports primary secondary events delay intervals. Next, outbreak usually estimating delays real time. result cases secondary event occurring time observed. called (right) truncation, biases observation process towards shorter delays: Finally, reality, ’s possible observe every case. suppose sample individuals size sample_size observed: sample size corresponds 8.7% data. Another issue, epidist currently account , sometimes secondary event might observed, primary event. example, symptom onset may reported, start infection unknown. Discarding events type leads called ascertainment biases.
