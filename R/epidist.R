#' Fit epidemiological delay distributions using a `brms` interface
#'
#' @param data An object with class corresponding to an implemented model.
#' @param formula An object of class [stats::formula] or [brms::brmsformula]
#' (or one that can be coerced to those classes). A symbolic description of the
#' model to be fitted. A formula must be provided for the distributional
#' parameter `mu`, and may optionally be provided for other distributional
#' parameters.
#' @param family A description of the response distribution and link function to
#' be used in the model. Every family function has a link argument allowing
#' users to specify the link function to be applied on the response variable.
#' If not specified, default links are used. For details of all supported
#' families see [brmsfamily()]. Commonly used, such as [lognormal()], are also
#' reexported as part of `epidist`.
#' @param prior One or more `brmsprior` objects created by [brms::set_prior()]
#' or related functions. These priors are passed to [epidist_prior()] in the
#' `prior` argument. Some models have default priors that are automatically
#' added (see [epidist_model_prior()]). These can be merged with user-provided
#' priors using the `merge_priors` argument.
#' @param merge_priors If `TRUE` then merge user priors with default priors, if
#' `FALSE` only use user priors. Defaults to `TRUE`. This may be useful if
#' the built in approaches for merging priors are not flexible enough for a
#' particular use case.
#' @param fn The internal function to be called. By default this is
#' [brms::brm()] which performs inference for the specified model. Other options
#' are [brms::make_stancode()] which returns the Stan code for the specified
#' model, or [brms::make_standata()] which returns the data passed to Stan.
#' These two later options may be useful for model debugging and extensions.
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to `fn` method.
#' @family fit
#' @export
