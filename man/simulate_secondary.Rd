\title{Simulate secondary events based on a delay distribution}
\usage{
simulate_secondary(linelist, dist = rlnorm, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{linelist}{A data frame with the primary event times.}

\item{dist}{The delay distribution to be used. Defaults to rlnorm.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to the delay distribution function.}
}
\value{
A data table that augments linelist with two new columns: delay
(secondary event latency) and stime (the time of the secondary event).
}
\description{
This function simulates secondary events based on a given delay
distribution. The input dataset should have the primary event times in a
column named 'ptime'.
}
