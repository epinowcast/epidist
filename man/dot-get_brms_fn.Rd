}
\arguments{
\item{prefix}{Character string prefix of the brms function to get (e.g.

\item{family}{A description of the response distribution and link function to
be used in the model. Every family function has a link argument allowing
users to specify the link function to be applied on the response variable.
If not specified, default links are used. For details of all supported
families see \code{\link[=brmsfamily]{brmsfamily()}}. Commonly used, such as \code{\link[=lognormal]{lognormal()}}, are also
reexported as part of \code{epidist}.}
