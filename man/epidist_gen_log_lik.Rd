\title{Create a function to calculate the marginalised log likelihood for double
censored and truncated delay distributions}
\usage{
epidist_gen_log_lik(family)
}
\arguments{
\item{family}{A description of the response distribution and link function to
be used in the model. Every family function has a link argument allowing
users to specify the link function to be applied on the response variable.
If not specified, default links are used. For details of all supported
families see \code{\link[=brmsfamily]{brmsfamily()}}. Commonly used, such as \code{\link[=lognormal]{lognormal()}}, are also
reexported as part of \code{epidist}.}
}
\value{
A function that calculates the marginal log likelihood for a single
observation. The prep object must have the following variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{vreal1}: relative observation time
\item \code{vreal2}: primary event window
\item \code{vreal3}: secondary event window
}
}
\description{
This function creates a log likelihood function that calculates the marginal
likelihood for a single observation by integrating over the latent primary
and secondary event windows. Where analytical solutions exist in
\code{\link[primarycensored:dprimarycensored]{primarycensored::dpcens()}} these are used, otherwise the integration is
performed numerically. \code{\link[primarycensored:dprimarycensored]{primarycensored::dpcens()}} handles the double
censoring and truncation of the delay distribution.
}
\details{
The marginal likelihood accounts for uncertainty in both the primary and
secondary event windows by integrating over their possible values, weighted
by their respective uniform distributions.
