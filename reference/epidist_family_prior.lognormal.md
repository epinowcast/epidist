# Family specific prior distributions for the lognormal family

We suggest priors to overwrite the `brms` defaults for the lognormal
family.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'lognormal'
epidist_family_prior(family, formula, ...)
```

## Arguments

- family:

  A description of the response distribution and link function to be
  used in the model. Every family function has a link argument allowing
  users to specify the link function to be applied on the response
  variable. If not specified, default links are used. For details of all
  supported families see `brmsfamily()`. Commonly used, such as
  [`lognormal()`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/brmsfamily.html),
  are also reexported as part of `epidist`.

- formula:

  An object of class
  [stats::formula](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/formula.html) or
  [brms::brmsformula](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/brmsformula.html)
  (or one that can be coerced to those classes). A symbolic description
  of the model to be fitted. A formula must be provided for the
  distributional parameter `mu`, and may optionally be provided for
  other distributional parameters.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to `fn` method.
