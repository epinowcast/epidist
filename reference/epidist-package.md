# epidist: Estimate Epidemiological Delay Distributions With brms

Understanding and accurately estimating epidemiological delay
distributions is important for public health policy. These estimates
influence epidemic situational awareness, control strategies, and
resource allocation. This package provides methods to address the key
challenges in estimating these distributions, including truncation,
interval censoring, and dynamical biases. These issues are frequently
overlooked, resulting in biased conclusions. Built on top of 'brms', it
allows for flexible modelling including time-varying spatial components
and partially pooled estimates of demographic characteristics.
