# epidist 0.1.0.1000

Development version of `epidist`.

## Package

- Remove the default method for `epidist()`. See #473.
- Added `enforce_presence` argument to `epidist_prior()` to allow for priors to be
  specified if they do not match existing parameters. See #474.
- Added a `merge` argument to `epidist_prior()` to allow for not merging user and package priors. See #474.
- Added user settable primary event priors to the latent model. See #474.
- Added a marginalised likelihood to the latent model. See #474.
- Generalised the stan reparametrisation feature to work across all distributions without manual specification by generating stan code with `brms` and then extracting the reparameterisation. See #474.

## Documentation

- Brings the README into line with `epinowcast` standards. See #467.

# epidist 0.1.0

This is the first minor release of `epidist` intended for early test users of the package.
As some features may change, the package is marked as experimental.
We expect to release a stable 1.0.0 version shortly.

The `epidist` package implements models for epidemiological delay distributions.
It uses [`brms`](http://paulbuerkner.com/brms/) to perform Bayesian inference.

One data format is currently available:

1. The [linelist data](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/reference/index.html#linelist-data) format

Two statistical models are currently available:

1. The [naive model](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/reference/index.html#naive-model): which models the delay directly using `brms`
2. The [latent model](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/reference/index.html#latent-model): which implements a latent variable model to correct for biases in the data

The package is readily extensible to additional models via an [S3](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html) class based system.
In particular, model fitting with [epidist()] is possible using S3 classes for custom:

1. [Families](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/reference/index.html#family)
2. [Formula](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/reference/index.html#formula)
3. [Prior distributions](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/reference/index.html#prior-distributions)
4. [Stan code](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/reference/index.html#stan-code)

We provide functionality for [post-processing](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/reference/index.html#postprocess).
Alternatively, users may directly use `tidybayes` for specific families.

Three vignettes are available.
There is also a [frequently asked questions](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/articles/faq.html) section.
