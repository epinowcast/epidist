Description: Understanding and accurately estimating epidemiological delay
    distributions is important for public health policy. These estimates
    influence epidemic situational awareness, control strategies,
    and resource allocation. This package provides methods to address
    the key challenges in estimating these distributions, including truncation,
    interval censoring, and dynamical biases. These issues are frequently
    overlooked, resulting in biased conclusions.
